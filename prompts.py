PLANNING_PROMPT = """\
You are a software architect, preparing to build the web page in the image. Generate a plan, \
described below, in markdown format.

In a section labeled "Overview", analyze the image, and describe the elements on the page, \
their positions, and the layout of the major sections.

Using vanilla HTML and CSS, discuss anything about the layout that might have different \
options for implementation. Review pros/cons, and recommend a course of action.

In a section labeled "Milestones", describe an ordered set of milestones for methodically \
building the web page, so that errors can be detected and corrected early. Pay close attention \
to the aligment of elements, and describe clear expectations in each milestone. Do not include \
testing milestones, just implementation.

Milestones should be formatted like this:

 - [ ] 1. This is the first milestone
 - [ ] 2. This is the second milestone
 - [ ] 3. This is the third milestone
